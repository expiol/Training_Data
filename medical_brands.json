The Care Quality Commission inspected the hospital in Woking in February 2013 and found it had failed eight of the nine “essential standards”.

The Morning Star described the company in January 2014 as representing \"some of the worst of NHS privatisation\", and pointing out that \"all three of Alpha's private mental health hospitals that were inspected by the Care Quality Commission in 2013 failed to meet some standards.\" The Care Quality Commission made unannounced visits in November and December 2013 to the hospital in Woking found it was failing to meet five out of the six national standards of quality and safety and issued formal warnings in respect of three of them – care and welfare of people, safeguarding people from abuse, and records as they had already been told that they needed to make a number of improvements during two previous visits. The company takes NHS patients from across England at a cost of up to £1,150 a day. 21 patients from Yorkshire were placed in the Bury hospital between April 2013 and March 2015. The Care Quality Commission inspected the hospital in Bury in February 2015. It found that the seclusion rooms, where patients are calmed or restrained, were dirty and not equipped with adequate washing facilities or natural light. Alpha Hospital Group was acquired in 2015 by Cygnet Health Care, owned by Universal Health Services, a Pennsylvania-based hospital management company."

IMO partners with various health care organizations, medical content providers and EHR developers. Founded in 1994, IMO is based in Rosemont, Illinois. IMO's clinical interface terminology, which helps to map diagnostic terminologies to medical concepts and billing codes, was launched in 1995. Products such as Problem (IT) and Procedure (IT) aim to help physicians more easily choose the correct medical term for their cases, which then aids in finding the correct billing code. This allows the clinician to capture the patient condition more accurately, with more familiar terms and without slowing the EHR workflow. These products' medical vocabularies are regularly updated so as to be mapped with standardized vocabularies such as ICD and SNOMED, as well as to adhere to the October 1, 2013/2014 date of compliance for migrating to ICD-10. Each IMO term within the clinical interface terminology is in turn mapped to the appropriate administrative code set. This allows the evolution of code sets to go on and minimize the impact on the clinician; as code sets/rules change, all re-mappings are handled by IMO, enabling the clinicians to continue leveraging the same vernacular. IMO works with companies such as MEDITECH, Allscripts, Cerner and Epic Systems, providing vocabularies for the companies' health care software applications to be used by various hospitals and physicians in those companies' client networks. IMO's products and vocabularies are thus used in sites across the United States. In 2012, IMO opened a research and development office on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign to be staffed by student interns from the university. In February 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article that demonstrates how IMO's interface terminology was found to accurately categorize coronary heart disease and heart failure events.

It was founded by Australian businessman Paul Ramsay, who established its parent company: Ramsay Health Care, in Sydney, Australia, in 1964 and has grown to become a global hospital group operating 151 hospitals and day surgery facilities across Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Indonesia and Malaysia. In 2007, Capio was acquired by Ramsay Health Care. It was the first purchase abroad for the company and beat a number of other rivals. At the time, Capio was the fourth largest private hospitals operator in the UK. In 2017 turnover fell 4.8% compared to 2016, down to £208 million, and this was blamed on \"NHS demand management strategies\". The company is more dependent on NHS work, largely through the Choose and Book system, than other private healthcare providers in the UK. In June 2018 it wrote down the value of some of its sites because NHS demand management strategies were having a significant negative impact on volume of business, but in 2019 it announced that NHS referrals had increased by 7.4% and it had benefited from an increase in NHS tariff prices. In 2021 it made a bid to acquire Spire Healthcare for almost £1 billion. Spire is a much bigger operation in the UK than Ramsay. The final price for Spire's 39 hospitals and eight clinics in the UK was agreed at $1.42 billion, but was rejected. Documents obtained by the Guardian and Good Law Project showed that Ramsay received £380 million in contracts from the UK government for surge capacity during the Covid-19 pandemic, but most of the beds provided went unused."

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom has increased use of remote health services, as people are more used to testing themselves at home.

The firm supplies more than 60% of the local authorities in England and claims to be the world’s biggest publicly-funded STI testing service. Some of the sexually transmitted infection tests involve filling up a vial of your own blood which some people find difficult. The firm discovered in a survey of 8,676 women that Trichomonas vaginalis was more common in women from ethnic minority backgrounds and they were also more likely to test positive when not displaying symptoms than white women. The firm polled 500 women in 2021 who attempted to access long-acting contraceptive choices and found that 30% could not get a long-acting reversible contraceptive coil or an implant because of the disruption of sexual health clinics.

The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. Bayer was founded in 1863 in Barmen as a partnership between dye salesman Friedrich Bayer and dyer Friedrich Weskott. As was common in this era, the company was established as a dyestuffs producer. The versatility of aniline chemistry led Bayer to expand their business into other area, and in 1899 Bayer launched the compound acetylsalicylic acid under the trademarked name Aspirin. In 1904 Bayer received a trademark for the \"Bayer Cross\" logo, which was subsequently stamped onto each aspirin tablet, creating an iconic product that is still sold by Bayer. Other commonly known products initially commercialized by Bayer include heroin, phenobarbitol, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates. In 1925 Bayer merged with five other German companies to form IG Farben, creating the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. Following World War II, the Allied Control Council seized IG Farben's assets because of its role in the Nazi war effort and involvement in the Holocaust including using slave labour from concentration camps and humans for dangerous medical testing, and production of Zyklon B, a chemical used in gas chambers. In 1951 IG Farben was split into its constituent companies, and Bayer was reincorporated as Farbenfabriken Bayer AG.

In response to an urgent, unmet need for COVID-19 test development and production in the United States, Curative rapidly shifted focus in March 2020. The company's research team developed a new test for SARS-CoV-2 that utilized oral swabs rather than nasopharyngeal swabs. The Curative test was designed with a scalable process and opportunities to reduce healthcare worker exposure risk and the amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) used. An independent manufacturing and supply chain model was adopted to avoid competing with existing COVID-19 test companies for limited supplies and laboratory capacity. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Curative's SARS-CoV-2 Assay in April 2020. By October 2020, nearly 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in the United States had been performed by Curative, and the company's weekly test processing capacity reached one million tests per week.

Endocyte retained rights to the development and commercialization of etarfolatide. Endocyte’s other preclinical drug candidates also target the folate receptor as well as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptors. The company was formed based on technology developed by Philip Low (the company's CSO), and Christopher Leamon, PhD, the company’s VP of research.

        "abstract": "Alvimedica is a manufacturer of coronary stents, balloon catheters, diagnostic and guiding catheters. The company was founded in 2007 by Turkish businessmen and scientists living in Denmark and Sweden. The major intention of the company is investing in small and medium size medical device manufacturers to enable them to compete globally. The company made its first investment move by purchasing a medical device company called Nemed in Turkey in 2007. Following this, the company purchased an American company called In-Vivo, a manufacturer of angioplasty and angiography catheters, and one of the suppliers of Abbott Laboratories. Alvimedica has one of the biggest Class 10.000 cleanrooms of Europe. An area of 700 m² - which also complies with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice)'s standards - contains the main assembly of catheter and stent systems, including the first drug-eluting stent developed and manufactured in Turkey: Coracto. While Prof. Nicolaus Reifart of the Main-Taunus-Privatklinik in Germany performed the clinical studies, CVPath's well-known Cardiac Pathologist Prof. Renu Virmani conducted animal studies on Coracto SDS (Stent Delivery System) and announced the results at EuroPCR 2009. The study conducted by Dr. Virmani used confocal, scanning electron and light microscopy to examine reendothelialization and inflammation at 14 and 28 days of Coracto, a rapamycin-eluting stent, versus, a sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) and an everolimus-eluting stent (EES) and a bare metal stent (Constant) as a control in a healthy rabbit iliac model. The trial was not powered for significance, but results show that endothelial coverage of Coracto at 14 days was better than that of both EES and SES. As expected, the bare metal stent showed greatest endothelial coverage. Alvimedica also develops projects in collaboration with universities in Turkey such as Boğaziçi University, Istanbul University, Sabancı University, Bilkent University, Yıldız Technical University, Yeditepe University, and international universities like Drexel University (USA), Medical University of Vienna (Austria), and as well as institutions like TASSA (Turkish American Scientists and Scholars Association), CVPath International Registry of Pathology (USA), or the Main-Taunus-Private Clinic (Germany). Alvimedica works with Stent for Life to provide staff training. In collaboration with TSC (Turkish Society of Cardiology), the company established Turkey's first cardiology simulation center. Together they provide training for Turkish cardiologists as part of an international project called Stent For Life. Through the training sessions the partnership aims at the early detecting of heart attacks and then making sure that the patient will receive the necessary treatment within an hour. Alvimedica’s headquarters are a 5.500 m² facility located at the free trade zone in Catalca, Istanbul, Turkey. Current projects include amongst others renal and cranial intravascular stents. The company is also working on bio-degradable stents which completely dissolve in the vessel. Alvimedica sponsored a team for the 2014–2015 Volvo Ocean Race, round-the-world sailing race."

ABSM shares office space and at least some staff with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) in Darien, Illinois, USA; the two organizations are closely related and serve basically the same constituency. In the past, the ABSM has offered four distinct examinations: \n* Sleep Medicine Specialty Certification Examination \n* Behavioral Sleep Medicine Certification Examination \n* Sleep Technologist Registry Examination \n* Sleep Scoring Proficiency Examination As of 2020 the ABSM still offers one examination: \n* Registered Sleep Technologist Examination (RST) The first two exams were offered mainly to physicians (MDs and DOs). However, non-physicians have taken and passed the exams. These have been mainly PhDs and DDSs. Therefore, the ABSM has put a disclaimer in its website cautioning everyone who has passed the exams to only practice medicine within the legal limits allowed. Those passing the Sleep Medicine Specialty Exam received the designation \"diplomate of the ABSM.\" As of 2006 3,445 persons had been awarded this designation. As of 2007 the ABSM stopped administering this exam. Now member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties offer specialty exams. The third and fourth exams on the list are geared toward sleep technologists. The Sleep Scoring Proficiency Examination is intended for those interested in the taking the Sleep Technologist Registry Examination. The latter exam was implemented in August 2011. The credential awarded to the individual passing this exam is the Registered Sleep Technologist (RST) credential. The first persons awarded the RST were Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (RPSGTs) who met the criteria the ABSM set forth to bypass taking the exam. The first RST credentials were awarded in August 2011. By September 11, 2011, 975 RST credentials were awarded; ten days later 1,549 individuals held this credential. The ABSM and the AASM have both been involved in promoting and explaining the rationale for the RST credential. Within the sleep community there has been much discussion and some disagreement about the launching of the RST credential when credentials already exist for the RPSGT (from the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (BRPT)) and the RRT-SDS and CRT-SDS (from the American Association of Sleep Technologists (AAST)).

In addition, as a result of condensing down the divisions, the company aims to implement and call the cloud its new home.

It is reducing its data centers from more than 30 to the single digits. GE is advocating for a simpler, more user-friendly approach to the world of IT. The whole point of the public cloud is that vendors – like AWS – provide those components as a service to customers. With this more public approach to a user-friendly service raises the concern for security. Randy Provoost, GE Technology Infrastructure marketing manager, put out a statement about how he plans to tackle and break down barriers with security systems in GE.

Founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. The company claimed that it had devised blood tests that required very small amounts of blood and that could be performed rapidly and accurately, all using compact automated devices which the company had developed. These claims were later proven to be false. A turning point came in 2015, when medical research professor John Ioannidis, and later Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos's technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients and others. By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. After several years of struggle, lawsuits, and sanctions from CMS, what remained of the company was dissolved on September 4, 2018. Theranos, Holmes and former company president Sunny Balwani were charged with fraud by the SEC in 2018. Holmes and Balwani were also charged with wire fraud and conspiracy, with Holmes being found guilty on four counts in January 2022 and sentenced that November to 11 years and 3 months in prison.

The company had been criticized for encouraging the practice of \"out-of-network billing\", which causes patients to be billed directly and at a much higher rate for medical services. This practice is particularly frequent in emergency room visits, in which the patient has little to no ability to choose their doctors. Researchers found that in half of 16 hospitals that used EmCare's services, out-of-network billing rose quickly and precipitously, and in the other half the out-of-network was already near 100% and did not decrease. In a larger sample of 194 hospitals in which EmCare handled billing, the average out-of-network billing rate was 62 percent, far higher than the national average. In contrast, when Emcare competitor TeamHealth took over billing in other hospitals, there was a much smaller increase in out-of-network billing.

        "abstract": "GoHealth is a marketplace for Medicare plans including Medicare Advantage, MediGap and Medicare Part D, which are programs administered through private health insurance companies. It also operates an online health insurance marketplace offering individual health insurance and short-term health insurance. In 2012, GoHealth became a government-approved exchange after a deal was signed into place by the Obama administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). This would allow GoHealth to enroll people in the same plans and offer the same tax-subsidies found on HealthCare.gov. CMS signed the deal with a few private health insurance marketplaces including GoHealth in an effort to provide affordable premiums from the increase in enrollment. In 2013, GoHealth acted as the first of the private health insurance marketplaces to enroll Americans in subsidy-eligible ObamaCare plans, following the technical challenges from HealthCare.gov's launch. Soon after a fix for broker functionality was implemented on HealthCare.gov, the company utilized their call centers to help Americans enroll in both on-exchange and off-exchange plans while on the phone. While customers had the ability to start the enrollment process using GoHealth's website, speaking with a representative allowed for the company to confirm a person's eligibility for subsidies and complete enrollment. The regulatory approval to enroll people in these plans only applied to residents from the 36 states that used the federal insurance exchange in lieu of a state exchange. In 2016, after growth from the Affordable Care Act slowed and following the departure of the former President Barack Obama from office, GoHealth turned its focus to Medicare. GoHealth is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with locations in Charlotte, North Carolina, Lindon, Utah, and Bratislava, Slovakia."

Affiliated with the Canadian Association of Blue Cross Plans, Medavie Blue Cross traces its history to E.A. van Steenwyk's 1933 creation of the Hospital Service Association of Minnesota, which became known as Blue Cross. Blue Cross eventually found its way into Canada, which had a private health care system at that time, and the Maritime Hospital Service Association was established in 1943, which became known as the Maritime Blue Cross - Blue Shield Association in 1954. With the creation of Canada's publicly funded universal health care system in the 1960s, the Blue Cross organizations began to evolve, providing travel insurance and individual health plans to supplement the publicly funded health care provided by each province. In 1986, the company renamed itself Blue Cross of Atlantic Canada and was headquartered in Moncton. The name was shortened to Atlantic Blue Cross Care (or just Atlantic Blue Cross) in 1999 when it merged with Maritime Medical Care, a nonprofit insurer based in Nova Scotia. The company became extremely successful during this period when several major contracts were awarded by large companies and public sector employers for their employee benefit plans, leading to the acquisition of the group business sectors of Ontario Blue Cross and Quebec Blue Cross. This necessitated a more bilingually appropriate name, so Medavie Blue Cross or Croix Bleue Medavie was adopted in 2003 and officially implemented in 2005. The name \"Medavie\" is a bilingual portmanteau which includes the terms \"medical\" and \"to live\" and describes the company's products, which include medical and life insurance. In 2007, for the third consecutive year, Medavie Blue Cross was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, the only non-profit medical insurance organization in Canada to receive this honour. On June 15, 2016, former New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Medavie Incorporated, effective September 1, 2016. Medavie Blue Cross is subsidiary of Medavie, a health organization. Medavie is a member of the Canadian Association of Blue Cross Plans (CABCP). All member plans operate independently and are governed by their own Board of Directors. Medavie is a not-for-profit organization, that channels its annual net income into investments aimed at enhancing the experience for its clients and an annual social dividend to the Medavie Health Foundation."
