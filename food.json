        "abstract": "A Cadbury Creme Egg is a chocolate confection produced in the shape of an egg, originating from the British chocolatier Fry's in 1963 before being renamed by Cadbury in 1971. The product consists of a thick chocolate shell containing an enzymatically-derived sweet white and yellow filling that resembles fondant. The filling mimics the albumen and yolk of a soft boiled egg from a fowl such as a chicken or goose. The Creme Egg is the best-selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million eggs and a brand value of approximately £55 million. However, in 2016 sales plummeted after the controversial decision to change the recipe from the original Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate to a cheaper substitute, with reports of a loss of more than £6M in sales. Creme Eggs are produced by Cadbury in the United Kingdom, by The Hershey Company in the United States, and by Cadbury Adams in Canada. They are sold by Mondelez International in all markets except the US, where The Hershey Company has the local marketing rights. At the Bournville factory in Birmingham in the UK, they are manufactured at a rate of 1.5 million per day. The Creme Egg was also previously manufactured in New Zealand, but has been imported from the UK since 2009. A YouGov poll saw the Creme Egg ranked as the most famous confectionery in the UK. While filled eggs were first manufactured by the Cadbury Brothers in 1923, the Creme Egg in its current form was introduced in 1963. Initially sold as Fry's Creme Eggs (incorporating the Fry's brand), they were renamed \"Cadbury's Creme Eggs\" in 1971."

Native to Central or South Asia, the cannabis plant has been used as a drug for both recreational and entheogenic purposes and in various traditional medicines for centuries. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract. Cannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time, difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory, impaired body movement (balance and fine psychomotor control), relaxation, and an increase in appetite. Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, but may take up to 90 minutes when eaten. The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used. At high doses, mental effects can include anxiety, delusions (including ideas of reference), hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and psychosis. There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the direction of causality is debated. Physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy; short-term side effects may also include dry mouth and red eyes. Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents, chronic coughing, susceptibility to respiratory infections, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Cannabis is mostly used recreationally or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). It is the most commonly used largely-illegal drug in the world, with the highest use among adults in Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria, as of 2018. While cannabis plants have been grown since at least the 3rd millennium BCE, evidence suggests that it was being smoked for psychoactive effects at least 2,500 years ago in the Pamir Mountains, Asia. Since the 14th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions. The possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis has been illegal in most countries since the 20th century. In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize recreational use of cannabis. Other countries to do so are Canada, Georgia, Malta, Mexico, South Africa, and Thailand. In the U.S., the recreational use of cannabis is legalized in 21 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia, though the drug remains federally illegal. In Australia, is legalized only in the Australian Capital Territory."

Standard American chop suey consists of elbow macaroni and bits of cooked ground beef with sautéed onions in a thick tomato-based sauce.

In accordance with this dual applicability, the method with which one determines the yearly timing of Bayrams is different for national and religious holidays.

State holidays in Turkey have set dates under the nationally-used Gregorian Calendar, while the Islamic religious holidays are coordinated and publicly announced in advance by the Government's Presidency of Religious Affairs department according to the Lunar Calendar, and are subsequently accommodated into the national Gregorian Calendar, which results in the dates for religious holidays changing every year with a shift margin of approximately 11 days.

        "abstract": "Bazin (Arabic: البازين, pronounced [baːˈziːn], is an unleavened bread in the cuisine of Libya prepared with barley, water and salt. Bazin is prepared by boiling barley flour in water and then beating it to create a dough using a magraf, which is a unique stick designed for this purpose. The dough may then be placed in a pan and allowed time to harden, after which it is baked or steamed. The salt contributes to the hardness of the bazin. Bazin may have a paste-like and hardened texture. It may also be prepared using whole wheat flour, olive oil and pepper as ingredients. Bazin is typically served with a tomato sauce, eggs, potatoes and mutton. This preparation method involves shaping the dough into the shape of a pyramid or dome, after which it may be served with a tomato-based soup or meat-and-potato stew poured atop or around it and garnished with hard-boiled eggs. A raw egg may also be placed in the hot soup. Aseeda is a dish prepared using bazin, honey, date syrup and butter or oil. Bazin may also be accompanied with a cooked pumpkin and tomato sauce mixture. When consumed, bazin may be \"crumpled and eaten with the fingers.\" It is typically eaten using the right hand, and may be consumed communally. Bazin has been described as a traditional dish and as a national dish of Libya."

Beauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of aesthetics, one of the major branches of philosophy. As a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart. Along with truth and goodness it is one of the transcendentals, which are often considered the three fundamental concepts of human understanding. One difficulty in understanding beauty is because it has both objective and subjective aspects: it is seen as a property of things but also as depending on the emotional response of observers. Because of its subjective side, beauty is said to be \"in the eye of the beholder\". It has been argued that the ability on the side of the subject needed to perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as the \"sense of taste\", can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run. This would suggest that the standards of validity of judgments of beauty are intersubjective, i.e. dependent on a group of judges, rather than fully subjective or fully objective. Conceptions of beauty aim to capture what is essential to all beautiful things. Classical conceptions define beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object as a whole and its parts: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. Hedonist conceptions see a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause disinterested pleasure. Other conceptions include defining beautiful objects in terms of their value, of a loving attitude towards them or of their function."

It consisted of a metal container, usually fitted with a handle and shaped somewhat like a modern frying pan, with a solid or finely perforated lid. The pan would be filled with embers and placed under the covers of a bed, to warm it up or dry it out before use. Besides the risk of fire, it was recognized that the fumes from the embers were noxious. A doctor advised his readers to avoid bed warmers, or, if needed, replace the embers with hot sand. An alternative to the bed warmer was the \"bed wagon\" (moine in French and monaco in Italian, both meaning \"monk\"). It consisted of a large wooden frame enclosing a bucket of embers, possibly with an iron tray and an iron roof-plate to protect the bed covers from direct heat. Bed warmers were commonly used from the mid-17th to early-20th century. They fell out of fashion with the rise of other methods of warming homes and beds. Pottery filled with hot water also was used.. With the advent of rubber, the hot water bottle became dominant. In the early 20th century, electric blankets began to replace the bed warmer. An alternative kind of bedwarmer in the mid-20th Century in the UK was a 36cm/14inch pressed steel 'flying saucer' or lozenge-shaped device made by Belling (established 1912), powered using an internal 40W incandescent light bulb as a heat source."

Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed.

Hor fun can be dry-fried (fried only with condiments such as soy sauce) or wet-fried (fried with a thickening sauce). Today, the dry-fried variant is much more common, to the extent that the method is usually not specified - \"hor fun\" on a restaurant menu would refer to dry-fried hor fun. Sliced beef is marinated first. Then, the beef is seared in a wok. Other ingredients and the hor fun noodles are added, then combined with the beef and sauce. The bean sprouts are then stir-fried with the rest of the chow fun until they are tender and the dish is ready to serve. An important factor in the making of this dish is wok hei (鑊氣). The cooking must be done over a high flame and the stirring must be done quickly. Not only must the hor fun be stirred quickly, it must not be handled too strongly or it will break into pieces.

The third most popular drink overall after water and tea - it is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above. Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling, pub quizzes and pub games.

Available in a variety of forms, the balls may be solid, or contain clappers or chimes within. Other, larger versions made of plastic encasing lesser balls are called Duotone balls. They are used by inserting them into the vagina and using the pubococcygeus muscles to hold them in, stimulating movement and/or vibration. Ben Wa balls should not be confused with anal kegel exercisers and prostate stimulators: Ben Wa balls sometimes have a retrieval string or attachment of some sort, but they do not have an adequately flared base for safe anal play. Ben Wa balls have a varied history; their origin and method of construction varies depending upon location. Most information concerning Ben Wa balls is vague and probably apocryphal. Originally they were made of a single ball placed in the vagina, used to enhance the act of sexual intercourse, but then evolved into multiple metal covered balls linked by either a chain or silk string for easy removal. Use of Ben Wa balls creates a subtle stimulation, not meant to bring the user to immediate orgasm but rather to tease. It is possible to leave Ben Wa balls in one's vagina all day, or use them while seated in a rocking chair, for an effect that some find pleasurable. Health experts caution against prolonged placement of foreign objects in the vagina due to the risk of infection. Ben Wa balls may also be used to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles, much as Taoist sexual practices have been used for centuries and the Kegel exercises are used today. Similar to Kegel exercises, Ben Wa balls and other shaped vaginal weightlifting equipment are recommended by gynecologists and obstetricians to increase vaginal elasticity and bladder control. Vaginal weights come in a spherical shape and are used in increasing weights to strengthen the vagina, which improves sexual performance. Practitioners of such spiritual traditions as Tantra and Chinese Taoism believe that Ben Wa Balls are helpful tools to exercise control and to explore the sensual side of an individual."

Pottage consistently remained a staple of poor people's diet throughout most of 9th to 17th-century Europe. When wealthier people ate pottage, they would add more expensive ingredients such as meats.

Spores of Clostridium botulinum can survive cooking at 100 °C (212 °F), and, in the anaerobic neutral pH storage environment, result in botulism.

        "name": "Price dispersion",
        "abstract": "In economics, price dispersion is variation in prices across sellers of the same item, holding fixed the item's characteristics. Price dispersion can be viewed as a measure of trading frictions (or, tautologically, as a violation of the law of one price). It is often attributed to consumer search costs or unmeasured attributes (such as the reputation) of the retailing outlets involved. There is a difference between price dispersion and price discrimination. The latter concept involves a single provider charging different prices to different customers for an identical good. Price dispersion, on the other hand, is best thought of as the outcome of many firms potentially charging different prices, where customers of one firm find it difficult to patronize (or are perhaps unaware of) other firms due to the existence of search costs. Price dispersion measures include the range of prices, the percentage difference of highest and lowest price, the standard deviation of the price distribution, the variance of the price distribution, and the coefficient of variation of the price distribution. In most theoretical literature, price dispersion is argued as result from spatial difference and the existence of significant search cost. With the development of internet and shopping agent programs, conventional wisdom tells that price dispersion should be alleviated and may eventually disappear in the online market due to the reduced search cost for both price and product features. However, recent studies found a surprisingly high level of price dispersion online, even for standardized items such as books, CDs and DVDs. There is some evidence of a shrinking of this online price dispersion, but it remains significant. Recently, work has also been done in the area of e-commerce, specifically the Semantic Web, and its effects on price dispersion. Hal Varian, an economist at U. C. Berkeley, argued in a 1980 article that price dispersion may be an intentional marketing technique to encourage shoppers to explore their options. A related concept is that of wage dispersion."

The modern American meaning of pudding as dessert has evolved from the original almost exclusive use of the term to describe savoury dishes, specifically those created using a process similar to that used for sausages, in which meat and other ingredients in mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents. In the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries, the word pudding is used to describe sweet and savoury dishes. Savoury puddings include Yorkshire pudding, black pudding, suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding.

Puddings made for dessert can be boiled and steamed puddings, baked puddings, bread puddings, batter puddings, milk puddings or even jellies. In some Commonwealth countries these puddings are known as custards (or curds) if they are egg-thickened, as blancmange if starch-thickened, and as jelly if gelatin-based.

        "name": "Punctuality",
        "abstract": "Punctuality is the characteristic of being able to complete a required task or fulfill an obligation before or at a previously designated time. \"Punctual\" is often used synonymously with \"on time\". An opposite personality trait is tardiness. According to each culture, there is often an understanding about what is considered an acceptable degree of punctuality. Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about five to ten minutes in most Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments. Some cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with African time. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised. In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm. In cultures that value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting. In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in econometrics and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in queueing theory."

        "name": "Pungmul",
        "abstract": "Pungmul (Korean: 풍물; Hanja: 風物; IPA: [pʰuːŋmul]) is a Korean folk music tradition that includes drumming, dancing, and singing. Most performances are outside, with dozens of players all in constant motion. Pungmul is rooted in the dure (collective labor) farming culture. It was originally played as part of farm work, on rural holidays, at other village community-building events, and to accompany shamanistic rituals, mask dance dramas, and other types of performance. During the late 1960s and 1970s it expanded in meaning and was actively used in political protest during the pro-democracy movement, although today it is most often seen as a performing art. Older scholars often describe this tradition as nongak (Korean: [noŋak]), a term meaning \"farmers' music\" whose usage arose during the colonial era (1910–1945). The Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea uses this term in designating the folk tradition as an Important Intangible Cultural Property. Opposition from performers and scholars toward its usage grew in the 1980s because colonial authorities attempted to limit the activity to farmers in order to suppress its use and meaning among the colonized. It is also known by many synonymous names throughout the peninsula. Drumming is the central element of pungmul. Each group is led by a kkwaenggwari (RR- ggwaenggwari) (small handheld gong) player, and includes at least one person playing janggu (hourglass drum), buk (barrel drum), and jing (gong). Wind instruments (taepyeongso, also known as hojeok, senap, or nalari) sometimes play along with the drummers. Following the drummers are dancers, who often play the sogo (a small drum without enough resonance to contribute to the soundscape significantly) and tend to have more elaborate—even acrobatic—choreography, particularly if the sogo-wielding dancers also manipulate the sangmo ribbon-hats. In some regional pungmul types, japsaek (actors) dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators, blurring the boundary between performers and audience. Minyo (folksongs) and chants are sometimes included in pungmul, and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along. Most minyo are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan (rhythmic patterns) that are common to pungmul, sanjo, p'ansori (RR-pansori), and other traditional Korean musical genres. Pungmul performers wear a variety of colorful costumes. A flowery version of the Buddhist gokkal is the most common head-dress. In an advanced troupe all performers may wear sangmo, which are hats with long ribbon attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns powered by knee bends. Pungmul was added to the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list as \"Joseonjok Nongak\" by China in 2009 and South Korea in November 2014."

        "abstract": "Purva paksha, (पूर्व पक्ष) sometimes also transliterated as Poorva paksha, literally means former view/position. It is a tradition in the debates of Indian Logicians. It involves building a deep familiarity with the opponent's point of view before criticising it. The purva paksha approach has been used by Adi Shankaracharya as well as Ramanuja and later acharyas in their works. In ancient Indian jurisprudence, purva paksha referred to the complaint, with other parts of a trial consisting of uttar (the later), kriyaa (trial or investigation by the court), and nirnaya (verdict or decision). In his book Being Different (2011), Rajiv Malhotra sought to use the purva paksha approach. Malhotra states that purva paksha is the traditional dharmic approach to rival schools. It is a dialectical approach, taking a thesis by an opponent ('purva pakshin') and then providing its rebuttal ('khandana') so as to establish the protagonist's views ('siddhanta'). The purva paksha tradition required any debater first to argue from the perspective of his opponent to test the validity of his understanding of the opposing position, and from there to realize his own shortcomings. Only after perfecting his understanding of opposing views would he be qualified to refute them. Such debates encourage individuals to maintain flexibility of perspective and honesty rather than seek victory egotistically.In this way, the dialectical process ensures a genuine and far-reaching shift in the individual. According to Shrinivas Tilak, Malhotra's use of purva paksha in Being Different may be regarded as a kind of \"reverse anthropology.\" Tilak states that By \"reversing\" the gaze on contemporary Western and Indological constructions of the dharmic worldview and ways of life, Malhotra seeks to expose how \"exotic,\" \"ethnic,\" and \"provincial\" such constructions have really been notwithstanding the West's allegedly \"universalistic\" claims (2011: 67, 176, 334). His other objective is to draw attention to the Christian-centric focus of the West's archive of knowledge and its historical involvement in the systematic suppression of the dharmic worldview and ways of life to be found in the works of Indologists. By problematizing the way in which Dharma has been represented by Western scholarship, he exposes the asymmetrical nature of the relationship that obtains between the powerful discipline of Indology and its disempowered subjects, the Indians (334)."

        "name": "Romance copula",
        "abstract": "In some of the Romance languages the copula, the equivalent of the verb to be in English, is relatively complex compared to its counterparts in other languages. A copula is a word that links the subject of a sentence with a predicate (a subject complement). Whereas English has one main copula verb (and some languages like Russian mostly express the copula implicitly) some Romance languages have more complex forms. Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and some other Romance languages have more than one copula verb. Conversely, French and certain others have only one. The development of copula verbs in Romance languages is explained by the fact that these are ultimately derived from three Latin verbs: \n* esse \"to be\" (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₁es-, as in English is). The verb esse was an irregular, suppletive verb, with some of its forms (e.g. fuī \"I was/I have been\") taken from the Proto-Indo-European root *bʰuH- meaning \"to become\" (as in English be). \n* stāre \"to stand\" or \"to stay\" (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *steh₂-, as in English stand and German stehen). \n* sedēre \"to sit\" (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *sed-, as in English sit). As the Romance languages developed over time, the three separate Latin verbs became just one or two verbs in the Romance languages. The reduction of three separate verbs into just one or two appears to have occurred as follows: \n* The irregular infinitive esse was remodeled into *essere. \n* *essere and sedēre forms sounded similar in Latin once the latter reduced to *seēre, and sounded even more similar after stress shifted in Spanish infinitives to the penultimate vowel. As a result, parts of the conjugations of erstwhile sedēre were subject to being integrated into conjugation paradigms associated with *essere, eventually ser. \n* stāre itself remained a separate verb, but stāre (later *istāre) and *essere were similar in some meanings, so that, especially in the Western Romance languages, stāre evolved into a second copula, with a meaning of \"to be (temporarily or incidentally)\"; *essere was then narrowed to mean \"to be (permanently or essentially)\". The development of two copular verbs in this manner occurred most completely in Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan. In other languages, most usages of English \"to be\" are still translated by *essere: \n* In Italian, the infinitive essere continues Latin esse as existential 'to be', while stare has the primary meaning \"to stay\" and is used as a copula only in a few situations: to express one's state of physical health (sto bene \"I am well\"); to form progressive aspects (sto parlando \"I am speaking\"); and (especially in the south of Italy) with the meaning of \"to be located\", although a distinction can be expressed in most varieties of Italian: è in cucina 'it's in the kitchen (where it usually is)' versus sta in cucina 'it's in the kitchen (where it isn't usually located)'. \n* In Old French, the verb ester < stāre maintained the Proto-Romance meaning of \"to stand, stay, stop\". In modern French, this verb has almost totally disappeared (see for the one exception), although the derivative verb of rester (\"to remain\") exists, and some parts of the conjugation of ester have become incorporated into être \"to be\" < *essere. As a result of this complex evolution, even though French has a single verb for \"to be\" (être), its conjugation is highly irregular."

In morphology, a root is a morphologically simple unit which can be left bare or to which a prefix or a suffix can attach. The root word is the primary lexical unit of a word, and of a word family (this root is then called the base word), which carries aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents.Content words in nearly all languages contain, and may consist only of, root morphemes. However, sometimes the term \"root\" is also used to describe the word without its inflectional endings, but with its lexical endings in place. For example, chatters has the inflectional root or lemma chatter, but the lexical root chat. Inflectional roots are often called stems, and a root in the stricter sense, a root morpheme, may be thought of as a monomorphemic stem. The traditional definition allows roots to be either free morphemes or bound morphemes. Root morphemes are the building blocks for affixation and compounds. However, in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the term \"root\" is generally synonymous with \"free morpheme\". Many such languages have a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word: Yup'ik, for instance, has no more than two thousand. The root is conventionally indicated using the mathematical symbol √; for instance, the Sanskrit root \"√bhū-\" means the root \"bhū-\"."

For the Samaritans, Ancient Hebrew ceased to be a spoken everyday language and was succeeded by Samaritan Aramaic, which itself ceased to be a spoken language some time between the 10th and 12th centuries and was succeeded by Arabic (or more specifically Samaritan Palestinian Arabic). The phonology of Samaritan Hebrew is very similar to that of Samaritan Arabic, and is used by the Samaritans in prayer. Today, the spoken vernacular among Samaritans is evenly split between Modern Israeli Hebrew and Palestinian Arabic, depending on whether they reside in Holon (Israel) or in Shechem (i.e. Nablus, in Palestine's Area A)."

It serves to complement the flavor of 100% agave tequila, which is similarly reminiscent of peppers and citrus. The peppery taste highlights tequila's crisp acidity and cleanses the palate. Before increased worldwide popularity and corporate interest in tequila in the late 1990s, consumption was largely localized to the vicinity of the tequila-producing state of Jalisco. A popular recipe in Guadalajara, Jalisco's largest city, was said to have originated from the leftover juices (mainly orange) of an equally popular regional fruit salad covered with fine chili powder, usually piquin. As the fruit salad, known to jalisquillos (Guadalajara's natives) as pico de gallo, was consumed from a large bowl during breakfast, the remaining juice was saved and poured on a small and narrow clay cup, which itself would be the precursor of the tequila shot glass. In almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice. The key to a balanced sangrita recipe can be found in the fruit salad's recipes, which would have included any or all of the following: tangerine, cucumber, papaya, mango and jicama. Traditionally, sangrita is served with tequila blanco, but it can also accompany tequila reposado. The tequila and sangrita are each poured into a separate shot glass (or caballito) and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. Sangrita is used in a drink known as \"The Mexican Flag\", where three separate double shot glasses are filled with lime juice, tequila and sangrita."

Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed-age whisky. A whisky without an age statement is known as a no age statement (NAS) whisky, the only guarantee being that all whisky contained in that bottle is at least three years old. The minimum bottling strength according to the regulation is 40% alcohol by volume. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky.

The concept of an enoteca has also spread to some other countries. A genuine enoteca is primarily directed at giving visitors or tourists the possibility to taste these wines at a reasonable price and possibly to buy them. An enoteca is often run in collaboration with growers or growers' or tourism organisations in the village or region. The reason such establishments were named to connote ”wine libraries” was that they were intended as a hands-on source of information on local wines rather than as regular outlets for larger quantities of each wine, or primarily intended for established customers. Often, an enoteca stocks rather small amounts of each wine, and customers who wish to purchase large quantities after tasting are referred directly to the producers. In some cases, an enoteca will also sell other local foodstuff and/or serve small snacks to go with the wines. A long-standing tradition that precedes the new coinage, is the wine shop in Palazzo Antinori, Florence, where Antinori wines have been available by the glass for more than a century. Enoteche have spread north of the Alps to Austria under the German name Vinothek and from Austria to Germany. Being associated with an enoteca is likely more beneficial to smaller, not too well-known producers than to large or well-established ones. Casual visitors will have an easier time discovering an enoteca, and the producer will not have to keep an outlet open in his winery just in case someone passes by to purchase a few bottles. On the other hand, having many wines are available side-by-side for tasting, comparison and competition, will be better for well-performing wineries."

Epidemics of infectious diseases are generally caused by several factors including a significant change in the ecology of the areal population (e.g., increased stress maybe additional reason or increase in the density of a vector species), the introduction of an emerging pathogen to an areal population (by movement of pathogen or host) or an unexpected genetic change that is in the pathogen reservoir. Generally, epidemics concerns with the patterns of infectious disease spread. An epidemic may occur when host immunity to either an established pathogen or newly emerging novel pathogen is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded. For example, in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic. An epidemic may be restricted to one location within one country or further develop more locations in a country, however, if it spreads to other regional countries or even among continents but only if affects or threatens a substantial number of population, it may be overseen as within the terms of pandemic. The registering and announcing of epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza, are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold) would not. An epidemic can cause enormous damage through financial and economic losses in addition to impaired health and loss of life."

The epi layer may be the same material as the substrate, typically monocrystaline silicon, or it may be a more exotic material with specific desirable qualities. Silicon epi wafers were first developed around 1966, and achieved commercial acceptance by the early 1980s. Methods for growing the epitaxial layer on monocrystalline silicon or other wafers include: various types of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) classified as Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Two \"kerfless\" methods (without abrasive sawing) for separating the epitaxial layer from the substrate are called \"implant-cleave\" and \"stress liftoff\". A method applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are the same material employs ion implantation to deposit a thin layer of crystal impurity atoms and resulting mechanical stress at the precise depth of the intended epi layer thickness. The induced localized stress provide a controlled path for crack propagation in the following cleavage step. In the dry stress lift-off process applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are suitably different materials, a controlled crack is driven by a temperature change at the epi/wafer interface purely by the thermal stresses due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the epi layer and substrate, without the necessity for any external mechanical force or tool to aid crack propagation. It was reported that this process yields single atomic plane cleavage, reducing the need for post lift-off polishing, and allowing multiple reuses of the substrate up to 10 times. The epitaxial layers may consist of compounds with particular desirable features such as gallium nitride (GaN), gallium arsenide (GaAs), or some combination of the elements gallium, indium, aluminum, nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic."

The toast was created for her by chef and fan Auguste Escoffier, who also created the Peach Melba dessert for her. The hotel proprietor César Ritz supposedly named it in a conversation with Escoffier. Melba toast is made by lightly toasting slices of bread under a grill, on both sides. The resulting toast is then sliced laterally. These thin slices are then returned to the grill with the untoasted sides towards the heat source, resulting in toast half the normal thickness. Thus, it can be described as a thrice-baked food (see rusk). Melba toast is also available commercially, and was at one time given to infants who were teething as a hard food substance on which to chew. In France, it is referred to as croûtes en dentelle."

Today, military chocolate is issued to troops as part of basic field rations and sundry packs. Chocolate rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency ration. Military chocolate rations are often made in special lots to military specifications for weight, size, and endurance. The majority of chocolate issued to military personnel is produced by the Hershey Company. When provided as a morale boost or care package, military chocolate is often no different from normal store-bought bars in taste and composition. However, they are frequently packaged or molded differently. The World War II K ration issued in temperate climates sometimes included a bar of Hershey's commercial-formula sweet chocolate. But instead of being the typical flat thin bar, the K ration chocolate was a thick rectangular bar that was square at each end. (In tropical regions, the K ration used Hershey's Tropical Bar formula.) When provided as an emergency field ration, military chocolate was very different from normal bars. Since its intended use was as an emergency food source, it was formulated so that it would not be a tempting treat that troops might consume before they needed it. Even as attempts to improve the flavor were made, the heat-resistant chocolate bars never received enthusiastic reviews. Emergency ration chocolate bars were made to be high in energy value, easy to carry, and able to withstand high temperatures. Withstanding high temperatures was critical since infantrymen would often be outdoors, sometimes in tropical or desert conditions, with the bars located close to their bodies.

A fourth variety, branded queijo padrão (\"standard\" cheese) has been developed more recently and can be found in nearly all supermarkets and grocery stores in Brazil. It is similar to frescal, but not as immensely juicy, soft and mild, and also generally less salty. Minas cheese is made from cow's milk according to traditional recipes. It used to be matured naturally in open air or, much less often, over a cooker to dry with the heat. Frescal cheese (as the name implies) is served quite fresh, about 4–10 days after preparation, still white and tender. Good frescal must be juicy, soft, and slightly granulated (instead of rubbery), with a mild taste. The saltiness of its taste might vary widely across producer. It is not good for cooking, except with beef or pork (the juice helps change its taste), or, as an ingredient to a wider recipe, grilled with sauces such as soy sauce until rubbery. It can be used to make sandwiches, pastries, and crêpes, but it gets slightly rubbery instead of stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked onions, tomato, as well as salad rockets, cooked spinach and other strong-tasting vegetables. Curado cheese is ready for consumption when the juice has evaporated and the cheese has solidified and acquired a yellowish tint. Good curado cheese must have a white core, punctured with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a stronger taste, tending to bitter.

Its ingredients are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European crusaders brought with them Middle Eastern recipes containing meats, fruits, and spices; these contained the Christian symbolism of representing the gifts delivered to Jesus by the Biblical Magi. Mince pies, at Christmastide, were traditionally shaped in an oblong shape, to resemble a manger and were often topped with a depiction of the Christ Child. The early mince pie was known by several names, including \"mutton pie\", \"shrid pie\" and \"Christmas pie\".

As a label, Mormonism has been applied to various aspects of the Latter Day Saint movement, although there has been a recent push from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to distance themselves from this label. A historian, Sydney E. Ahlstrom, wrote in 1982, \"One cannot even be sure, whether [Mormonism] is a sect, a mystery cult, a new religion, a church, a people, a nation, or an American subculture; indeed, at different times and places it is all of these.\" However, scholars and theologians within the Latter Day Saint movement, including Smith, have often used \"Mormonism\" to describe the unique teachings and doctrines of the movement. A prominent feature of Mormon theology is the Book of Mormon, which describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God. Mormon theology includes mainstream Christian beliefs with modifications stemming from belief in revelations to Smith and other religious leaders. This includes the use of and belief in the Bible and other religious texts, including the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. Mormonism includes significant doctrines of eternal marriage, eternal progression, baptism for the dead, polygamy or plural marriage, sexual purity, health (specified in the Word of Wisdom), fasting, and Sabbath observance. The theology itself is not uniform; as early as 1831, and most significantly after Smith's death, various groups split from the Church of Christ that Smith established. Other than differences in leadership, these groups most significantly differ in their stances on polygamy, which the Utah-based LDS Church banned in 1890, and Trinitarianism, which the LDS Church does not affirm. The branch of theology which seeks to maintain the practice of polygamy is known as Mormon fundamentalism and includes several different churches. Other groups affirm Trinitarianism, such as the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), and describe their doctrine as Trinitarian Christian restorationist. Cultural Mormonism is a term coined by cultural Mormons who identify with the culture, especially present in Utah and Idaho, but do not necessarily identify with the theology."

In its broadest sense, mortar includes pitch, asphalt, and soft mud or clay, as those used between mud bricks, as well as cement mortar. The word \"mortar\" comes from Old French mortier, \"builder's mortar, plaster; bowl for mixing.\" (13c.). Cement mortar becomes hard when it cures, resulting in a rigid aggregate structure; however, the mortar functions as a weaker component than the building blocks and serves as the sacrificial element in the masonry, because mortar is easier and less expensive to repair than the building blocks. Bricklayers typically make mortars using a mixture of sand, a binder, and water. The most common binder since the early 20th century is Portland cement, but the ancient binder lime mortar is still used in some specialty new construction. Lime, lime mortar, and gypsum in the form of plaster of Paris are used particularly in the repair and repointing of historic buildings and structures, so that the repair materials will be similar in performance and appearance to the original materials.

The books do not name any author, as authorship was not considered important by the society that produced them, and it was only after Jews came into intense contact with author-centric Hellenistic culture in the late Second Temple period that the rabbis began to find authors for their scriptures. The tradition that Moses was this author probably began with the legalistic code of the Book of Deuteronomy and was then gradually extended until Moses, as the central character, came to be regarded not just as the mediator of law but as author of both laws and narrative. By the 1st century CE, it was already common practice to refer to the five books as the \"Law of Moses\", but the first unequivocal expression of the idea that this meant authorship appears in the Babylonian Talmud, an encyclopedia of Jewish tradition and scholarship composed between 200 and 500 CE. There, the rabbis noticed and addressed such issues as how Moses had received the divine revelation, how it was curated and transmitted to later generations, and how difficult passages such as the last verses of Deuteronomy, which describe his death, were to be explained. This culminated in the 8th of Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith, establishing belief in Mosaic authorship as an article of Jewish belief. Mosaic authorship of the Torah was unquestioned by both Jews and Christians until the European Enlightenment, when the systematic study of the five books led the majority of scholars to conclude that they are the product of multiple authors throughout many centuries. Despite this, the role of Moses is an article of faith in traditional Jewish circles and for some Christian Evangelical scholars, for whom it remains crucial to their understanding of the unity and authority of the Bible."

Local legend has it that the tradition began because May 1 was the day the first Dutch settlers set out for Manhattan, but The Encyclopedia of New York City links it instead to the English celebration of May Day. While it may have originated as a custom, the tradition took force of law by an 1820 act of the New York State Legislature, which mandated that if no other date was specified, all housing contracts were valid to the first of May – unless the day fell on a Sunday, in which case the deadline was May 2."

It is thought to be an imitation of the Alsatian washed-rind Munster cheese, introduced by German immigrants. It is distinct from the processed dairy food Sweet Muenster Cheese. Its name is not related to the German cities of Münster in Westphalia or in Lower Saxony or the Irish province of Munster, but rather to the city of Munster in Alsace, which was part of Germany at the time the cheese was introduced in the US by German immigrants, but is now in France. Muenster is pale in color and smooth in texture with an orange rind. The cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk. The rind's orange color is from annatto, a sweet and nutty seasoning used to add flavor and color to cheeses such as Cheddar, Colby, Red Leicester, and Mimolette. Muenster usually has a very mild flavor and smooth, soft texture. In some cases, when properly aged, it can develop a strong flavor with a pungent aroma. This cheese is commonly served as an appetizer. Because it melts well, it is also often used in dishes such as grilled cheese sandwiches, tuna melts, quesadillas, cheeseburgers, macaroni and cheese, and pizza. The spelling \"Muenster\" distinguishes the American cheese from Munster cheese, which is made from unpasteurized cow's milk in the Vosges mountains in Alsace. The orange tinge of Munster's rind occurs naturally as a byproduct of the cheese-making process. A regional variation is also produced in the Franche-Comté region in France.

Also known as mumming or janneying, it typically involves a group of friends or family who dress in disguise and visit homes within their community or neighbouring communities during the twelve days of Christmas. If the mummers are welcomed into a house, they often do a variety of informal performances that may include dance, music, jokes, or recitations. The hosts must guess the mummers' identities before offering them food or drink. They may poke and prod the mummers or ask them questions. To make this a challenge for the hosts, the mummers may stuff their costumes, cross-dress, or speak while inhaling (ingressive speech). Once the mummers have been identified, they remove their disguises, spend some social time with the hosts, and then travel as a group to the next home."

        "abstract": "Mura (斑) is a Japanese word meaning \"unevenness; irregularity; lack of uniformity; nonuniformity; inequality\", and is a key concept in the Toyota Production System (TPS) as one of the three types of waste (muda, mura, muri). Waste in this context refers to the wasting of time or resources rather than wasteful by-products and should not be confused with Waste reduction. Toyota adopted these three Japanese words as part of their product improvement program, due to their familiarity in common usage. Mura, in terms of business/process improvement, is avoided through Just-In-Time systems which are based on keeping little or no inventory. These systems supply the production process with the right part, at the right time, in the right amount, using first-in, first-out (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a “pull system” in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub-processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts. This type of system is designed to maximize productivity by minimizing storage overhead. For example: 1. \n* The assembly line “makes a request to,” or “pulls from” the Paint Shop, which pulls from Body Weld. 2. \n* The Body Weld shop pulls from Stamping. 3. \n* At the same time, requests are going out to suppliers for specific parts, for the vehicles that have been ordered by customers. 4. \n* Small buffers accommodate minor fluctuations, yet allow continuous flow. If parts or material defects are found in one process, the Just-in-Time approach requires that the problem be quickly identified and corrected."

Mutscheln are roughly star-shaped and come in various sizes: usually approximately six inches in diameter, but bakeries often offer breads three or more feet in diameter. The most common Mutschel is made of wheat, yeast, a small amount of fat like lard or butter and eggs. They are sometimes made in sweet varieties. There are several theories about the origin of the bread form. One is that the high central part of the bread represents the castle atop the Achalm, a hill next to Reutlingen, and the eight points of the star represent medieval guilds. The star could also have Christian allegorical meaning as the Star of Bethlehem. A third possibility is that Reutlingen baker Albrecht Mutschler invented the shape in the 14th century.

        "name": "Nanoparticle",
        "abstract": "A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is usually defined as a particle of matter that is between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter. The term is sometimes used for larger particles, up to 500 nm, or fibers and tubes that are less than 100 nm in only two directions. At the lowest range, metal particles smaller than 1 nm are usually called atom clusters instead. Nanoparticles are usually distinguished from microparticles (1-1000 µm), \"fine particles\" (sized between 100 and 2500 nm), and \"coarse particles\" (ranging from 2500 to 10,000 nm), because their smaller size drives very different physical or chemical properties, like colloidal properties and ultrafast optical effects or electric properties. Being more subject to the brownian motion, they usually do not sediment, like colloidal particles that conversely are usually understood to range from 1 to 1000 nm. Being much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light (400-700 nm), nanoparticles cannot be seen with ordinary optical microscopes, requiring the use of electron microscopes or microscopes with laser. For the same reason, dispersions of nanoparticles in transparent media can be transparent, whereas suspensions of larger particles usually scatter some or all visible light incident on them. Nanoparticles also easily pass through common filters, such as common ceramic candles, so that separation from liquids requires special nanofiltration techniques. The properties of nanoparticles often differ markedly from those of larger particles of the same substance. Since the typical diameter of an atom is between 0.15 and 0.6 nm, a large fraction of the nanoparticle's material lies within a few atomic diameters of its surface. Therefore, the properties of that surface layer may dominate over those of the bulk material. This effect is particularly strong for nanoparticles dispersed in a medium of different composition since the interactions between the two materials at their interface also becomes significant. Nanoparticles occur widely in nature and are objects of study in many sciences such as chemistry, physics, geology and biology. Being at the transition between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures, they often exhibit phenomena that are not observed at either scale. They are an important component of atmospheric pollution, and key ingredients in many industrialized products such as paints, plastics, metals, ceramics, and magnetic products. The production of nanoparticles with specific properties is a branch of nanotechnology. In general, the small size of nanoparticles leads to a lower concentration of point defects compared to their bulk counterparts, but they do support a variety of dislocations that can be visualized using high-resolution electron microscopes. However, nanoparticles exhibit different dislocation mechanics, which, together with their unique surface structures, results in mechanical properties that are different from the bulk material. Non-spherical nanonparticles (e.g., prisms, cubes, rods etc.) exhibit shape-dependent and size-dependent (both chemical and physical) properties (anisotropy). Non-spherical nanoparticles of gold (Au), silver (Ag), and platinum (Pt) due to their fascinating optical properties are finding diverse applications. Non-spherical geometries of nanoprisms give rise to high effective cross-sections and deeper colors of the colloidal solutions. The possibility of shifting the resonance wavelengths by tuning the particle geometry allows using them in the fields of molecular labeling, biomolecular assays, trace metal detection, or nanotechnical applications. Anisotropic nanoparticles display a specific absorption behavior and stochastic particle orientation under unpolarized light, showing a distinct resonance mode for each excitable axis. This property can be explained by the fact that on a daily basis there are new developments being made in the field of synthesis of these nanoparticles for preparing them in high yield."

It was included in a cookbook for schools in 1896. One book suggests using it as a food to comfort distressed mental patients. The dish was served as part of the menu for students in Memorial Hall, Harvard in 1882, where their food was described as looking better than it tastes. In the Philippines, a common macaroni soup is known simply as sopas (\"soup\" in Tagalog). It originated from the American chicken noodle soup. It is made with macaroni, various vegetables and meat (usually chicken), with added evaporated milk. It is regarded as a comfort food and commonly served during cold days or to sick people. In Los Angeles it is sometimes served with chilli. The soup is also known in Indonesia and Malaysia, where it is sometimes served with chicken balls. In Indonesia, macaroni soup is an easy dish often served for children and during sahur meals in Ramadan. Macaroni in soup is also commonly found in Hong Kong, especially in Cha chaan teng (Hong Kong-style cafes). McDonald's in Hong Kong serve the dish in its breakfast menu."

It is also found in North Macedonia and Serbia. They are made with flour, eggs, yogurt, a leavening agent, water, salt, and oil. In Serbia they are called mekike (sing. mekika), mekica or pitulica, and in Bulgaria mekitsa. They are similar to Hungarian lángos and British Yorkshire pudding. Mekitsa is conventionally a breakfast dish. After the dough rises, it is torn into small balls, spread into flat rounds and fried in oil. In some recipes, yeast, baking soda, milk or yogurt might be used. A recipe from Silistra involves yogurt and bread soda, one from a village near Stara Zagora uses yeast and yogurt, and a recipe from Aytos suggests yeast and milk. One of the oldest known recipes contains only yeast, flour, salt and sugar and it uses water as the sole wet ingredient. It is recommended that the shaping of mekitsi before their frying be done with wet or oiled hand hands, using most commonly vegetable oil. When served, mekitsa is often powdered with icing sugar or garnished with jam, honey or sirene (white cheese). It can also be eaten with yogurt. In North Macedonia people prepare the dish the week after a newborn is born. That is like a celebration for the newborn baby, tradition says that it should be in the house where the baby will live, but nowadays this celebration mostly happens in restaurants. The dish was invented in the 5th century in modern-day Bulgaria, and is still relevant and popular in the Serbian, Bulgarian, and North Macedonian regions and is a common cultural dish. The name is derived from the Slavic root mek (\"soft\"), referring to the dish's texture. –itsa is a Slavic feminine suffix. It tastes like and also has the same ingredients as the naan flatbread of the Indian subcontinent but the only difference is that naan is baked in a traditional clay oven, called tandoor unlike mekista."

The ratio of milk to eggs is higher than in a traditional Portuguese custard tart or Chinese egg tart, resulting in a lighter texture and a stronger milk flavour.

Some recipes require that the custard be baked in the crust, while others call for the custard to be prepared in advance, and then placed in the crust before serving. Cinnamon is often sprinkled over its surface, and the milk used for the custard may also be infused with a cinnamon stick before preparation.

They are made from an enriched dough covered in a thin layer of crisp cookie dough. Their appearance resembles a melon, such as a rock melon (cantaloupe). They are not traditionally melon flavored, but in recent times it has become popular for manufacturers to add melon flavoring to melon bread. Variations exist, including some with a few chocolate chips between the cookie layer and the enriched dough layer, and non-melon versions flavored with caramel, maple syrup, chocolate, or other flavors, sometimes with syrup, whipped or flavored cream, or custard as a filling. In the case of such variations, the name may drop the word \"melon\", instead replacing it with the name of the contents (such as \"maple pan\" for a maple syrup flavored bread) or may keep it despite the lack of melon flavor (such as \"chocolate melon pan\"). The name has a bilingual etymology, since \"melon\" is a loan word from English, while \"pan\" is from the Portuguese word for bread. In parts of the Kansai, Chūgoku, and Shikoku regions, a variation with a radiating line pattern is called \"sunrise\", and many residents of these regions call even the cross-hatched melon pan \"sunrise\". Melonpan and pineapple bun from Hong Kong are very similar. By comparison, the Japanese style is lighter in weight and taste, slightly drier and has a firmer outer layer (including top cookie crust) which resists flaking, unlike its Hong Kong counterpart, whose top cookie crust tends to flake easily. The Hong Kong version is also moister, and is generally soft on the outside and inside, with a stronger butter flavour."

The term Mardijker is a Dutch corruption of the Portuguese version of the original Sanskrit words and was used to designate former Portuguese and Dutch slaves from India in the East Indies, known as Mardijkers, whence the Malay meaning of \"free(dom)\" is derived. The Mardijkers were former Catholic slaves brought from India and the East Indies, who were liberated by the Dutch if they abandoned Catholicism and joined the Dutch Reformed Church. The term was used by the anti-colonialist and pro-independence movements in the colonial territories of the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and the Straits Settlements. It became a rallying call for those demanding independence from the colonial administrations of the Netherlands and United Kingdom. In the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, the Moro people belonging to major ethnolinguistic groups of Meranaw, Maguindanaw, and Iranun, use maradeka in the same meaning as freedom or liberation and a political group there is called Maradeka.

What facts are metaphysically necessary, and on what basis we might view certain facts as metaphysically but not logically necessary are subjects of substantial discussion in contemporary philosophy. The concept of a metaphysically necessary being plays an important role in certain arguments for the existence of God, especially the ontological argument, but metaphysical necessity is also one of the central concepts in late 20th century analytic philosophy.

The sausages have a strong flavor, and are made from raw minced pork which is then air dried. Droge worst simply means \"dry sausage\", referring to drying process and texture of the product. The name metworst (Met from Low German word mett, \"minced pork without bacon\") is similar to the German Mettwurst, though only in name, as the taste and preparation of both sausage types is very different. Metworst is traditionally found throughout the Netherlands and Flanders. Most of the production is the northern provinces of the Netherlands, Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe, where wind conditions are most suitable for rapidly air drying the sausages. Finnish meetvursti resembles the Dutch metworst or salami: it is dry, hard, strong-flavored, dense, usually made of pork and eaten as a cold cut on bread. Some recipes, typically those sold as 'Russian style', include horse meat. Meetvursti sold in supermarkets will often say \"may contain horse meat\" as a precaution due to this. In Sweden, sliced medwurst sausage (boiled or smoked) is typically used on bread for breakfast. Originally metworst, thanks to its preservability, served as an emergency meat supply to poor farmers in times of need or lack of fresh meat. As meat production gradually rose, the sausage began to be used as lunch for field laborers.

A more modern form of Monégasque cuisine has developed since the Monte Carlo casino-resort's conception in the mid-nineteenth century. Some now associate the cuisine with international influences, cosmopolitanism, gastronomy and Michelin-starred restaurants. However, recent years have also seen a revitalised interest in Monaco’s authentic local recipes and its more traditional culinary heritage."

The blend of spices and molasses, rolled paper thin, has a reputation as the \"World's Thinnest Cookie\". They are related to German Lebkuchen; original recipes can be traced back to the 17th century. The cookie is especially popular around, and usually associated with, Christmas in communities with a strong Moravian background such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which still maintain the two largest Moravian communities in the United States. Traditionally, prominent homes in the community hosted open houses which contained elaborate Nativity scenes. These scenes were often built around large tree stumps which were found in the woods near the town. People opened their homes for viewings of these scenes, and offering cookies to guests was an important part of the tradition. The spice cookies were central to the occasion, but many families also made a sugar cookie which was made with butter and flavored heavily with nutmeg. Families made their own cookie cutters and handed them down to family members. The shapes were primarily farm animals, as part of the Nativity tradition. Families often had a few cookie cutters which were large and intricate and took real skill to cut out and bake. Although there are a few bakeries that still roll and cut the cookies by hand, some now use a mechanized process for making the cookies in order to meet the demand. While this does not affect the taste, the machine-made cookies have been criticized for not being as thin as their handmade counterparts. While the spice recipe is the most traditional and well-known of the Moravian cookies, other versions have appeared over the years, including sugar, lemon, black walnut, and chocolate varieties."

In Murcia, Albacete and in some Spanish-speaking regions of the Valencian Community, morcón is a sausage made with cooked pork, stuffed in a bladder, similar to mortadella. In the Valle de Ayora there is a variant known by the name perro. In old Spanish from the 16th century it was understood as blood sausage. The marinade used to flavor the chorizo is mainly composed of paprika, garlic and salt. Due to the thickness of the sausage, the maturity period is quite long. In the Philippines, the sausage has evolved into a stuffed meat roulade. The meat, which could be beef or pork, is cut into thin sheets and wrapped around hard-boiled eggs, ham, sausages, carrots, pickled cucumber slices and other ingredients to form a solid sausage. The roulade is usually cooked using a stewing and frying technique, and sliced when cool."

The word is derived from Russian word Mormysh (Russian: мормыш) meaning Freshwater Shrimp (Gammarus). Mormyshka was invented in the 19th century in Russia. The prototypes were big spoon lures used for ice fishing. Trying to imitate shrimps, anglers made lures smaller and changed the way of fixing them on the line. As a result, efficient lures appeared and were spread quickly among ice fishermen all around Russia and Scandinavia. Mormyshka consists of a metallic head, often made of tungsten, and a hook soldered in it. There is a small vertical hole in the middle of the head where the line passes through. The way to knot Mormyshka to the line is unusual, but is not difficult. The line is put through the hole and tied to the hook.When suspended, Mormyshka keeps an almost horizontal position, and the point of the hook is above its shank. Some mormyshkas have a Bead Head on the hook. In contrast to Jig Heads, original Russian Mormyshka jigs have no up eye;Mormyshkas are not always globe-shaped. There are many forms that provide different presentations to fish;Usually, high quality Mormyshka is not painted, but coated or plated with Nickel, Brass, Copper, Gold, Silver, or combination of two metals, that provides better attraction to fish. For the past few years Mormyshka has been used in summer fishing as well with long poles and a float or a nod. It is used either with live bait or alone. Also, anglers use palmers tied on Mormyshkas."

Since the earliest operas were staged in the Netherlands in the 17th Century the preference has always been for original Italian, French and German versions, or occasionally French translations of Italian and German works. The 1680s saw the first pastoral semi-operas in Dutch, De triomfeerende Min (1678) and Bacchus, Ceres en Venus (1686). The 18th century saw development of the zangspel (singspiel), such as Zemire en Azor (1784), but these failed to establish a vernacular opera tradition. With a few notable exceptions – such as the 1834 Dutch-language opera Saffo by Johannes Bernardus van Bree to a libretto by Jacob van Lennep (1802–1868), the 19th century saw no major Dutch-language operas. While there continued to be a tradition of art song and choral compositions in Dutch, in the 20th and 21st century original Dutch language opera compositions were to remain rare, and such as in the case of Willem Pijper's Halewijn (1932–34, after the tale of Heer Halewijn) not always well received. Dutch-language translations of Italian standards were produced from 1886 by the Dutch Opera Company of Johannes George de Groot starting a minor strand in opera performance which persisted, with closures and openings of various opera companies, until World War I, and again in the inter-war years. A revived attempt to produce operas sung in Dutch was made by De Nederlandse Opera in the years following World War II. Similarly in Belgium the Vlaamse Opera sang French and Italian works in Dutch till the 1980s.

Milk spoils easily so most farms instead produced a small eyed cheese that had its curing process started by mixing in a small batch of fermented curds. This was common practice from the 16th though 19th centuries. Today, this style of cheese once produced in churches across Sweden is factory-made from pasteurized cow's milk. Prästost is sometimes soaked or cured in whisky or other spirits; Saaland Pfarr is one such whisky-soaked variant. A version of prästost aged for 12 months and cured in Absolut vodka has been marketed as VODCheese. A 1969 USDA booklet describes the manufacturing technique for one whisky-cured style of prästost: Fresh, whole milk is set with rennet at a temperature of 90°F. When the curd is very firm, it is cut coarsely, then put in a sieve to allow the whey to drain off. The curd is collected in a cloth and kneaded to expel more whey. Whisky is mixed with the curd, then the curd is packed in a basket and salt is sprinkled on the surface. Curing is done in a cool, moist cellar. The cloth covering is changed daily for 3 days, and the cheese is washed with whisky after the third day."

Purées of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus. The term is of French origin, where it meant in Old French (13th century) purified or refined. Purées overlap with other dishes with similar consistency, such as thick soups, creams (crèmes) and gravies—although these terms often imply more complex recipes and cooking processes. Coulis (French for \"strained\") is a similar but broader term, more commonly used for fruit purées. The term is not commonly used for paste-like foods prepared from cereal flours, such as gruel or muesli; nor with oily nut pastes, such as peanut butter. The term \"paste\" is often used for purées intended to be used as an ingredient, rather than eaten. Purées can be made in a blender, or with special implements such as a potato masher, or by forcing the food through a strainer, or simply by crushing the food in a pot. Purées generally must be cooked, either before or after grinding, in order to improve flavour and texture, remove toxic substances, and/or reduce their water content. It is common to purée entire meals (without use of salt or other additives) to be served to toddlers, babies, and those unable to chew as sufficient, nutritious meals. Baby food is often a mash."

A small cylindrical Oltermanni wrapped in a yellow bag was given to each Valio milk producer in 1980 as a gift to celebrate Valio's 75th anniversary. Cheese for general sale was launched in 1981. At the same time, a researcher who wrote a doctoral thesis at the Oltermann Institute proposed the cheese to Oltermanni, which subsequently came true. In 1997, Oltermann began to produce lighter version of the cheese with a fat content of 17% by weight. The product family expanded in 2008 with a 9% low-fat version.

There are two kinds of oncom: red oncom and black oncom. Oncom is closely related to tempeh; both are foods fermented using mold. Usually oncom is made from the by-products from the production of other foods: soy pulp remains from making tofu, peanut press cake remains after the oil has been pressed out, cassava tailings when extracting the starch (pati singkong), coconut press cake remaining after oil has been pressed out or when coconut milk has been produced. Since oncom production uses by-products to make food, it increases the economic efficiency of food production. Red oncom has been found to reduce the cholesterol levels of rats. Black oncom is made by using Rhizopus oligosporus while red oncom is made by using var. oncomensis. It is the only human food produced from Neurospora."

The experiment lasted from 1869–1879. It was not considered as part of the larger eugenics history because of its radical religious context. The term \"stirpiculture\" was used by John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community, to refer to his system of eugenics, or the breeding of humans to achieve desired perfections within the species. Noyes derived stirpiculture from the Latin word \"stirps\", which means \"stock, stem, or root\" (Carden). It has been claimed that Noyes coined the term two decades before Francis Galton created the term \"eugenics\". In 1904, Galton claimed that he had first come up with the term and \"deliberately changed it for eugenics,\" a claim supported in print by George Willis Cooke. In his 1883 book Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development, Galton noted that his new term \"eugenics\" was a suitable replacement for the older term \"viriculture\" that he had invented, suggesting that he had confused the two terms \"viriculture\" and \"stirpiculture.\""

Often referred to by using popular brand names, such as the 'Happy Hut' or the 'Snuggle Sack', a parrot tent is typically hung from the roof of the parrot's cage using two or more clips. Several designs of tent are commercially available, for example soft canopies that sit over an existing perch, open-ended tubes and prisms, or fully enclosed teepee or dome-shaped bags with a single opening. Care must be taken to ensure that the parrot does not consume pieces of the tent or accidentally become entangled and trapped in frayed threads, both of which may occur if the bird's natural chewing instincts compel it to gnaw upon the fabric and natural wood is not provided. The parrot may also come to view the tent as a potential nesting site, which may trigger unwanted behaviours in a pet bird, such as egg-laying and aggression in defence of the tent, although this varies from individual to individual.

Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery. The word \"pastries\" suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries as a synecdoche. Common pastry dishes include tarts, quiches, croissants, and pasties. The French word pâtisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) for the same foods. Originally, the French word pastisserie referred to anything, such as a meat pie, made in dough (paste, later pâte) and not typically a luxurious or sweet product. This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century, though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today. Pastry can also refer to the pastry dough, from which such baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products. Pastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture. A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for yeast bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers."

Patatnik is made of grated potatoes, onions, salt and a type of very mild mint called Gyosum in Bulgarian, all mixed and cooked on a slow fire. Some restaurants add sirene (white cheese) or eggs, but this is not traditional; some people also use savory and peppers. The grated potatoes are squeezed out and mixed with the onions. Some of the doughy mixture that has formed is rolled into two sheets. One of the sheets is placed on the bottom of the dish and should be larger in diameter than it so as it comes out a fair bit. The remaining mixture is spiced with savory, poured on top of the first sheet, covered with the other sheet; the edges of both sheets should cover each other: in that respect, it resembles a \"potato banitsa\". According to one of the preparation methods, the patatnik is turned over when the bottom is well cooked and slipped into the dish with the heated side. According to other recipes, no sheets are formed and instead the ingredients are mixed until they become homogeneous; these are then cooked in a deep dish on a slow fire. After 20 minutes the mixture is turned over and covered and then cooked further. The dish is traditional for the entire Rhodopes and the nearby regions, from Bansko in Pirin through Smolyan and Zlatograd to as far east as Chernichevo. The name is derived from the local word patato or pateto, \"potato\", with the Bulgarian masculine suffix –nik. The word is typical for the Rup dialects spoken in the Rhodopes. It is distinct from both standard Bulgarian kartof (картоф) and the western Bulgarian kompir (компир). In Nedelino, the dish is known as kashnitsa (кашница)."

        "name": "Patch cut",
        "abstract": "Patch cuts are logging cuts too small to be considered clearcuts, and are instead considered a form of selection cut. A typical patch cut might be 2-3 tree lengths. Below a certain size, seedling regeneration advantage shifts from the shade intolerant species favored in clearcuts to the shade tolerant species favored by selection harvests. An areas of patch cuts of different shapes were tried in the Northern hemisphere to see where shade tolerant and shade intolerant species might regenerate. It was found in small patches (1/10 acre) N. 44° that there was a limited solar exposure of only a few hours (3-4) and this would lead to strongly shade tolerant and moderately shade tolerant trees dominating over time. Yet at slightly larger (1/2 acre) patches much more sunlight for longer was reaching the forest floor. This would warm the floor more, increase nutrient release and thus more light demanding species could grow faster and might then reach maturity in the stand. As well as light other factors to be considered are wind to avoid windthrow, pathogens and fire risk. Positive benefits can also be gained if patches keep horizontal biodiversity in a forest stand and for an owner with not so much forest this may be useful for keeping non-timber forest products in usable amounts. Patch cuts can have less visual impact than clearcuts, and can mimic some stand disturbance processes. Patch cuts can also be simpler to implement than trying to selectively log individual trees within a selection cut. Patch cuts are distinct from the group selection method. A patch would pick several trees to be big enough to allow regeneration of a specific species, perhaps that has problems growing due to shade intolerance or another factor, as several together. Whereas a group would be only a few mature trees (3-5) and would not necessarily favor a shade intolerant species to establish into a group. In a patch the edge effect would be overcome but in a group most likely not. Patch cuts may be used in a hybrid system with the single tree selection cut method or the group tree selection cut method."

This flavor line was not meant to compete with brands like Orange Crush, but rather fill out the line. Patio sodas were available in the cold-bottle market: grocery and mom-and-pop stores. Advertising for Patio was comparatively scarce; at the time, bottlers were regionally franchised, and related advertising was necessarily local. In 1964, Patio Diet Cola became Diet Pepsi. The newly branded diet soda was advertised alongside Pepsi, with the tagline \"Pepsi either way\", which replaced the slogan \"Dances with flavor\". Most of the remaining Patio line of flavors were phased out by the early 1970s, while a few survived until the mid-1970s.

It has three documented phenotypes. These are: \n* formation of a double cell membrane and separation between the two membranes; \n* formation of large vacuoles in the supranuclear cytoplasm, their subsequent fusion with each other and with the lateral cell membranes thus separating the apical portion; \n* formation of many tiny vesicles that fuse with each other and the cell membrane thus severing portions of the cell.

It is quite typical in fairs and verbenas. A smaller version of the serranito is known as the montadito. As the origin of this typical dish today, there are the \"Échate pa' ya\" bars in the Cerro del Águila and Juan XXIII neighborhoods of Seville in the 1970s. From that formula, the ex-bullfighter José Luis Cabeza Hernández , who during his active time was known as José Luis del Serranito, patented the trademark and the term Serranito, as well as the tapa."

        "name": "Super Fun 21",
        "abstract": "Super Fun 21 is a variation of blackjack. The game is played using a standard 52 card deck. Aces can be counted as either a one or eleven depending on which value would best benefit the player's hand. All the face cards in the deck each count as ten. The remaining cards are taken at face value. The player must first place a bet and is then dealt two cards face up. The dealer is dealt two cards as well, but one is face up and one face down. The player then has the option to either \"hit\", (request another card) or \"stand\" (decline additional cards). The player's hand must beat the dealer's by coming closer to 21 without \"busting\" (exceeding 21). A winning hand with a total of 21 is called a blackjack, or natural. The game differs from traditional blackjack because the player automatically wins if his hand has six cards or more with a total of 20. This rule applies even if the dealer has a total of 21 (blackjack). Other advantages to Super Fun 21 include being able to split a hand up to four times, a player's blackjack supersedes a dealer's blackjack, a player may \"double down\" at any point no matter how many cards he has been dealt, and the player automatically doubles their money with a hand consisting of five cards or more that total 21. The other major difference between Super Fun 21 and traditional blackjack is that a blackjack only pays 6 to 5 instead of the traditional 3 to 2 payout. This more than makes up for the edge the casino is giving with the liberal rules variations above. Super Fun 21 was protected by U.S. Patent number 5,979,897 issued in 1999 to Howard F. Grossman, a well-known Las Vegas gaming consultant, and assigned to Tech Art Management, Inc. Special Side Bet. Player can place a \"side bet\" on getting a blackjack in a designated suit (e.g. diamonds) only in the first round of a newly shuffled deck or decks. The payout is 300:1 (as indicated in the diagram). Some casinos allow player to designate suit or suits for this special side bet. Due to the high house edge on this side bet (9.2%), it is not popular and most land based and on line casinos excluded this from their games. Not to be confused with a similar blackjack variation called Fun 21."
