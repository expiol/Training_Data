Though he started his writing career as an author of young-adult fiction, where the father/son conflict is a major theme, he is best known for his later novels of suspense, most of which are set, at least in part, in Italy, reflecting his academic background as a scholar of Italian culture. His thriller League of Shadows, for example, deals with the Fascist Era in Italy and its aftermath in the contemporary world. A later international thriller, Nine Days in October, came out of the author's course research on the forces of order and disorder in contemporary Italy and follows a band of criminals and ex-terrorists as they attempt to carry out an assassination plot. All of his novels, including Storm Track and Tropic of Fear, the latter set in Paraguay, are noted for their strong sense of place. In most of his novels, his protagonist is usually a common man placed in a situation where powerful forces are arrayed against him. While his novels take place in the modern era, Terpening's academic research has focused on Italian authors of the Renaissance, most notably the Venetian Humanist Lodovico Dolce, although he has also published a study of the infernal boatman Charon and numerous articles on other writers of the 15th and 16th centuries.

Freundel was regarded as \"a brilliant scholar,\" a \"profound\" orator and an authority in several areas of halakha (Jewish law), including eruvim, which he assisted in constructing in a number of cities, including Washington. Freundel's career came to a sudden end in October 2014 when he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and charged with committing voyeurism of several women in a mikveh (Jewish ritual bath). Kesher Israel immediately suspended him without pay and later notified the congregants that he had been fired. Similarly, he was also suspended from membership in the Vaad and the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), the main professional association for Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States. He also was suspended from his multiple academic positions. He was assistant professor of rabbinics at Baltimore Hebrew University, where he was the rabbinic studies graduate program adviser, associate professor at Towson University and adjunct lecturer at the Georgetown University Law Center. Towson University immediately opened its own administrative review of Freundel's conduct with students, while Georgetown University began its own investigation as well. Freundel ultimately pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism and was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and fined $13,000. On August 28, 2018, the $100 million class action lawsuit which had been brought on behalf of the victims against Freundel and the organizations he was associated with was dropped in lieu of a settlement of $14.25 million, to be paid by the insurance of the parties named in the suit.

Bernard Krainis, a noted recorder player and a founding member of the New York Pro Musica Antiqua and the Aston Magna Foundation for Music, two pioneering ensembles for the performance of early music on period instruments, died on Aug. 18, 2000 at his home in Great Barrington, Mass. He was 75. The cause of death was cancer, his family said. Mr. Krainis was born in New Brunswick, N.J., on Dec. 28, 1924, the son of Abraham and Rose Sachs Krainis. During World War II he served in the Army, stationed in India with the Seventh Bomber Group. He attended Denver University. But it was his studies at New York University, where he was a student of the medieval and Renaissance music scholar Gustave Reese, that determined the future course of his life. In 1952, along with the conductor and musicologist Noah Greenberg, Mr. Krainis formed the New York Pro Musica Antiqua, which brought wider public attention to early music and was in the forefront of the period-instrument movement. Mr. Krainis performed with the group until 1959. In the 1960s he organized and toured with his own ensembles: the Krainis Baroque Trio, the Krainis Baroque Ensemble and the Krainis Consort, becoming one of the few recorder players at the time to have a prominent solo career. In the early 1970s he was a founding member of Aston Magna, which is still a force in the revival of early music, presenting concerts and sponsoring an important summer music festival at its headquarters in Great Barrington, where Mr. Krainis moved in 1969. In 1985, at 60, he retired as a performer. But he remained active as a board member and teacher at Aston Magna. He also taught at Kirkland College, Columbia University, the Eastman School of Music and Smith College. Mr. Krainis is survived by his wife, Betty; a son, John, of Freeport, Me.; a stepson, David H. Lippman of Great Barrington; two stepdaughters, Deborah Morris of Great Barrington and Judith Grant of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a sister, Esther James of Freeland, Wash.; and nine grandchildren. Though he was a specialist in early music, Mr. Krainis had wide-ranging musical interests. His friend Andrew L. Pincus, the music critic of The Berkshire Eagle, recalled in a recent tribute that Mr. Krainis could frequently be seen at the yearly Tanglewood Festival of Contemporary Music in Lenox, Mass., and that his assessments of new works were insightful. \"He had perfect pitch for both quality and cant,\" Mr. Pincus wrote, \"and could be merciless in his judgments of fakery.\""

He was equally passionate about anatomy, enthusiastically seeking out and dissecting the largest and finest specimens, including whales, and troubling his colleagues with his single-minded quest for money and space for his collection. His collection was donated to Surgeon's Hall in Edinburgh. Among scientists, he is perhaps best known for his work on the ligament which bears his name. His work on the rare and vestigial ligament of Struthers came to the attention of Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent of Man to help argue the case that man and other mammals shared a common ancestor ; or \"community of descent,\" as Darwin expressed it. Among the public, Struthers was famous for his dissection of the \"Tay Whale\", a humpback whale that appeared in the Firth of Tay, was hunted and then dragged ashore to be exhibited across Britain. Struthers took every opportunity he could to dissect it and recover its bones, and eventually wrote a monograph on it. In the medical profession, he was known for transforming the teaching of anatomy, for the papers and books that he wrote, as well as for his efficient work in his medical school, for which he was successively awarded medicine's highest honours, including membership of the General Medical Council, fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the presidency of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and finally a knighthood."

Goddard successfully launched his rocket on March 16, 1926, which ushered in an era of space flight and innovation. He and his team launched 34 rockets between 1926 and 1941, achieving altitudes as high as 2.6 km (1.6 mi) and speeds as fast as 885 km/h (550 mph). Goddard's work as both theorist and engineer anticipated many of the developments that would make spaceflight possible. He has been called the man who ushered in the Space Age. Two of Goddard's 214 patented inventions, a multi-stage rocket (1914), and a liquid-fuel rocket (1914), were important milestones toward spaceflight. His 1919 monograph is considered one of the classic texts of 20th-century rocket science. Goddard successfully pioneered modern methods such as two-axis control (gyroscopes and steerable thrust) to allow rockets to control their flight effectively. Although his work in the field was revolutionary, Goddard received little public support, moral or monetary, for his research and development work. He was a shy person, and rocket research was not considered a suitable pursuit for a physics professor. The press and other scientists ridiculed his theories of spaceflight. As a result, he became protective of his privacy and his work. Years after his death, at the dawn of the Space Age, Goddard came to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry, along with Robert Esnault-Pelterie, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth. He not only recognized early on the potential of rockets for atmospheric research, ballistic missiles and space travel but also was the first to scientifically study, design, construct and fly the precursory rockets needed to eventually implement those ideas. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center was named in Goddard's honor in 1959. He was also inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in 1966, and the International Space Hall of Fame in 1976."

        "name": "David A. Karp",
        "abstract": "David Allen Karp (born 1944) is a Professor of Sociology at Boston College where he has taught since 1971. He received his B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1966 and his Ph.D. in Sociology from New York University in 1971. He has written or co-authored nine books and more than fifty journal articles and book chapters. His work appears in such periodicals as Symbolic Interaction, Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, Journal of Qualitative Health Research, the Gerontologist, and the International Journal of Aging and Human Development. His work has largely clustered in three areas: urban life and culture, aging, and the study of mental health and illness. Professor Karp’s career-long research work is both motivated by and advances “symbolic interaction theory,” sociology’s distinctive version of social psychology. His diverse writings are animated and united by the core “social constructionist” question, “How do people make sense of complicated life circumstances and how are their behaviors, emotions, and attitudes linked to such interpretive processes?” Over the course of more than 40 years he has explored a variety of topics. His doctoral dissertation on the nature of “urban anonymity” involved participant observation in New York’s Times Square area. This initial interest in the social psychology of city life led to the publication of his co-authored and widely respected book entitled Being Urban: A Sociology of City Life. As an assistant professor at Boston College he also co-authored a book on the “sociology of everyday life.” Always using his sociology to reflect on issues of personal significance, Professor Karp later collaborated on Experiencing the Life Cycle: A Social Psychology of Aging. This book challenged deterministic notions of a universal aging process. In the early 1980s Professor Karp wrote a series of path-breaking papers on the social and emotional lives of people in their fifties, at that point a neglected moment in the life course. Among the several articles produced from this study, the most provocative and widely acclaimed was his paper entitled “A Decade of Reminders.” This article (featured in the science section of The New York Times) argues that there is an internal quickening of one’s feelings of growing older in the fifties as those in that decade experience a momentum of social reminders about age (Karp calls them body reminders, generational reminders, contextual reminders, and mortality reminders). The paper is a model for those who wish to understand the intersection of global social factors, the immediate life circumstances of individuals, and how people construct personal identities. Like many of his journal articles, his classic study with entitled “The College Classroom: Some Observations on the Nature of Student Participation” has been reprinted multiple times. In addition, he has co-authored a series of articles on what happens in upper-middle-class families during the year that a child applies to college. However, for nearly two decades his abiding interest has been to decipher the experiences of mental illness. Professor Karp began his series of books and articles on mental illness in the late 1980s. His exceedingly influential book entitled Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness (Oxford, 1996) is the first in a series of three books on the subject. This book reveals Karp’s status as a methodological craftsperson who artfully combines in-depth interviewing, personal experience, and cogent analysis. This book was very positively reviewed in The New York Times and won the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction’s Charles Horton Cooley Award in 1996. Speaking of Sadness enjoys a wide public audience and is frequently used in basic sociology courses, courses on social psychology, and courses on health and illness, among others. Professor Karp’s second book on mental illness was published in 2000. The Burden of Sympathy: How Families Cope with Mental Illness (Oxford, 2000) is an equally compelling book that makes an enduring contribution to the study of mental illnesses and the emotions that surround them. Based on 60 interviews with the family and friends of persons with depression, manic-depression, or schizophrenia, this book shows how caregivers negotiate enormously complicated boundaries of obligation. As with Speaking of Sadness, this book brings sophisticated sociology to a general public. In 2006 Harvard University Press published Professor Karp’s third book on mental illness. Is It Me or My Meds? Living with Antidepressants focuses on the relationship between pills and person hood. Karp powerfully argues that while all drugs potentially impact our sense of self, psychiatric drugs are unique because they are designed to reshape people’s moods, feelings, behaviors and perceptions. To the extent that these drugs alter people’s emotions they have a profound effect on the essential nature of their identities. Taken together, his writings pose critical challenges to exclusively biological explanations of and treatments for mental illness. His three books on mental illness have received a number of exceptionally favorable academic reviews and are enormously valuable resources for patients and caregivers, mental health practitioners, and fellow sociologists."

His most recent book is entitled What is Christianity?, which argues that Christianity can never be defined by any static set of beliefs but is instead a diverse, flexible, and still developing movement of people seeking to love God and serve their neighbors in an ever-changing, multicultural world."

Thumboo graduated in English from the University of Malaya in 1956. Although he applied for a position at the university, he was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore worked in the civil service for about nine years before finally joining the university, then renamed the University of Singapore, in 1966 following Singapore's independence. He received a Ph.D. from the university in 1970. Thumboo rose to the position of full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993. After the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore (NUS), he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991, NUS's longest-serving dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Thumboo was the first Chairman and Director of the university's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005, and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor, a position he has held since retiring from full-time teaching in September 1997. Thumboo's poetry is inspired by myth and history, and he is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes. A pioneer of local English literature, he compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry and fiction from Singapore and Malaysia. His own collections of poetry include Rib of Earth (1956), Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993).

She was a member of the Danish resistance movement fighting against the German occupation of Denmark. She began studying French and German at the University of Copenhagen in 1929. She specialized in linguistics and her thesis treated \"the importance of dialect geography for the perception of sound changes\". From 1933 she became a member of the Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen which evolved around Louis Hjelmslev and his theory of glossematics. Tired of the theoretical discussions of Hjelmslev's circle, she took up research in the field of phonetics in which she became an international figure, publishing widely used text books about general phonetics and phonological theory. She also corresponded with Roman Jakobson through many years and had met on several occasions. During the German occupation of Denmark from 1940 to 1945, she worked in the resistance group of Professor Carsten Høeg and under great risk helped him assemble a list of Danish nazis to be prosecuted after the liberation. She was a corresponding member of the Danish Academy of the Sciences and the British Academy."
